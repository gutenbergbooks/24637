		VARIETIES OF BROMIDE PAPERS AND
		HOW TO CHOOSE AMONG THEM</h2>

		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">What</span> is bromide paper? It is simply paper
		coated with gelatino-bromide of silver emulsion,
		similar to that which, when coated on
		glass or other transparent support, forms the familiar
		dry-plate or film used in negative-making. The emulsion
		used in making bromide paper, however, is less
		rapid (less sensitive) than that used in the manufacture
		of plates or films of ordinary rapidity; hence bromide
		paper may be manipulated with more abundant light
		than would be safe with plates. It is used for making
		prints by contact with a negative in the ordinary
		printing frame, and as the simplest means for obtaining
		enlarged prints from small negatives. Sometimes
		bromide paper is spoken of as a development paper,
		because the picture-image does not print out during
		exposure, but requires to be developed, as in negative-making.
		The preparation of the paper is beyond
		the skill and equipment of the average photographer,
		but it may be readily obtained from dealers in photographic
		supplies.</p>

		<p>What are the practical advantages of bromide paper?
		In the first place, it renders the photographer independent
		of daylight and weather as far as making prints
		<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"></a>is concerned. It has excellent “keeping” qualities,
		<em>i.e.</em>, it does not spoil or deteriorate as readily as other
		printing papers, even when stored without special
		care or precaution. Its manipulation is extremely
		simple, and closely resembles the development of a
		negative. It does not require a special sort of
		negative, but is adapted to give good prints from negatives
		widely different in quality. It is obtainable in
		any desired size, and with a great variety of surfaces,
		from extreme gloss to that of rough drawing paper.
		It offers great latitude in exposure and development,
		and yields, even in the hands of the novice, a greater
		percentage of good prints than any other printing
		paper in the market. It offers a range of tone from
		deepest black to the most delicate of platinotype grays,
		which may be modified to give a fair variety of color
		effects where this is desirable. It affords a simple
		means of making enlargements without the necessity
		of an enlarged negative. It gives us a ready means
		of producing many prints in a very short time, or, if
		desired, we may make a proof or enlargement from the
		negative fresh from the washing tray. And, finally,
		if we do our work faithfully and well, it will give us
		permanent prints.</p>

		<p>The bromide papers available in this country at
		present are confined to those of the Eastman Kodak
		Company, the Defender Photo Supply Company and
		J. L. Lewis, the last handling English papers only.
		Better papers could not be desired. Broadly speaking,
		all bromide papers are made in a few well-defined varieties;
		in considering the manipulation of the papers
		made by a single firm, therefore, we practically cover
		<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"></a>all the papers in the market. As a matter of convenience,
		then, we will glance over the different varieties
		of bromide paper available, as represented by the Eastman
		papers, with the understanding that what is said
		of any one variety is generally applicable to papers of
		the same sort put out by other manufacturers.</p>

		<p>First we have the <em>Standard</em> or ordinary bromide
		paper made for general use. This comes in five different
		weights: <em>A</em>, a thin paper with smooth surface,
		useful where detail is desirable; <em>B</em>, a heavier paper with
		smooth surface, for large prints or for illustration purposes;
		and <em>C</em>, a still heavier paper with a rough surface
		for broad effects and prints of large size. <em>BB</em>, heavy
		smooth double weight; <em>CC</em>, heavy, rough, double
		weight. Each of these varieties may be had in two
		grades, according to the negative in hand or the effect
		desired in the print, viz.: <em>hard</em>, for use with soft negatives
		where we desire to get vigor or contrast in the
		print, and <em>soft</em>, for use with hard negatives where
		softness of effect is desired in the print. For general
		use the <em>soft</em> grade is preferable, although it is advisable
		to have a supply of the <em>hard</em> paper at hand as useful
		in certain classes of work. The tones obtainable on
		the <em>Standard</em> paper range to pure black, and are acceptable
		for ordinary purposes. For pictorial work or
		special effects other papers are preferable.</p>

		<p><em>Platino-Bromide</em> paper gives delicate platinotype
		tones, and where negative, paper and manipulation are
		in harmony, the prints obtained on this paper will be
		indistinguishable from good platinotypes in quality
		and attractiveness. This paper comes in two weights,
		<em>Platino A</em>, a thin paper suitable for small prints, and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"></a>having a smooth surface useful for detail-giving;
		and <em>Platino B</em>, a heavy paper with rough surface,
		peculiarly suited for large contact prints or enlargements.
		Both varieties are obtainable in <em>hard</em> or <em>soft</em>
		grades, characterized as above. <em>Matte Enamel</em>, medium
		weight; <em>Enameled</em>, medium weight; <em>Velvet</em>, medium
		weight.</p>

		<p><em>Royal Bromide</em> is a capital paper in its proper place,
		<em>i.e.</em>, for prints not smaller than <span class="keep_together">8 × 10</span> inches, and
		then only when breadth of effect is desired in the picture.
		It is a very heavy cream-colored paper, rough
		in texture, and giving black tones by development,
		but designed to give sepia or brown tones on a tinted
		ground by subsequent toning with a bath of hypo and
		alum. This paper, also, may be had in two grades for
		<em>hard</em> or <em>soft</em> effects; it is further adapted for being printed
		on through silk or bolting cloth, this modification adding
		to the effect of breadth ordinarily given by the paper
		itself. I have seen prints on this paper which were
		altogether pleasing, but subject and negative should
		be carefully considered in its use. Rough Buff papers
		are very similar in character. <em>Monox</em> Bromide, made
		by the Defender Photo Supply Company, is obtainable
		in six surfaces; No. 3, <em>Monox Rough</em>; No. 4, <em>Monox
		Gloss</em>; No. 5, <em>Monox Matte</em>; No. 6, <em>Monox Lustre</em>;
		No. 7, <em>Monox Buff</em>, heavy rough.</p>

		<p>The Barnet bromide papers, comprising ten different
		varieties, differing in weight and surface texture but
		very similar to the kinds already described, are imported
		by J. L. Lewis, New York.</p>

		<p>As a suggestion to the reader desiring to have at hand
		a stock of bromide papers, I would advise <em>Platino A</em>,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"></a>or a similar <em>soft</em> paper for prints under <span class="keep_together">5 × 7</span> inches;
		<em>Matte-Enamel</em> for <em>soft</em> effects, or a similar paper, as
		an alternative; <em>Platino C</em> and <em>Royal Bromide</em> for <em>soft</em>
		effects, or similar papers, for prints <span class="keep_together">8 × 10</span> inches or
		larger, and for enlargements. To these might be added
		a package of <em>Standard B</em>, and another of one of the
		above varieties for <em>hard</em> effects, to complete a supply
		for general purposes. The beginner, however, will do
		well to avoid the indiscriminate use of several varieties
		of paper, although he is advised to get information of
		all the different varieties in the market. It is better
		to select that variety which is best suited to the general
		character of one’s negatives and work, and to master
		that before changing to another. It is true that an
		expert can get more good prints on bromide paper,
		from a given number of bad negatives, than another
		expert can get with the same negatives and any other
		printing paper; but it is also true that for the best
		results on bromide paper the variety of paper used
		should be suitable for the negative. It will be found,
		however, that this word “suitable” covers, in bromide
		printing, a much wider range than is offered by many
		printing papers. In fact there are only two sorts of
		negatives which will not yield desirable prints on
		bromide paper: first, an exceedingly weak, thin negative
		lacking in contrast and altogether flat; and second,
		a very dense negative in which the contrasts are
		hopelessly emphatic. Even in such cases, however,
		it may be possible to modify the negatives and so get
		presentable prints.</p>

		<p>The ideal negative for contact printing on bromide
		paper is one without excessive contrasts on the one
		<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"></a>hand, and without excessive flatness on the other.
		A moderately strong negative, such as will require
		from three to five minutes in the sunlight with a print
		out paper, fairly describes it. In other words, the
		negative should be fully exposed and so developed that
		there is a fair amount of density in the shadows. I
		have never been able, with bromide paper, to get the
		detail in the shadows of under-exposed negatives,
		such as we see in a good print made on glossy printout
		paper. For this reason the use of bromide papers
		with under-exposed negatives is not advisable. But
		there are a great many negatives which, while unsuitable
		as they come from the drying rack, can be easily
		adapted to the process by slight modifications. A
		very dense negative, for instance, may be reduced
		either with the ferricyanide of potash or persulphate of
		ammonia reducer; and a thin negative with proper
		graduations can frequently be intensified to advantage
		in the print. While, as has been said, there is great
		latitude in the matter of the negative, this latitude
		should only be availed of when necessary. Local reduction
		or intensification of the negative is seldom
		necessary, as better results can usually be obtained
		with bromide paper by dodging in the printing.</p>

		THE QUESTION OF LIGHT AND
		ILLUMINATION</h2>

	<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Thus</span> far we have gained a general understanding
	of the different papers and the characteristics
	desirable in negatives. Before we take up the
	actual manipulation of bromide paper there are a few
	elementary principles bearing on the important detail
	of illumination which we must master. These may
	necessitate a little thinking, but a practical grasp of
	them will make our after-work much easier, and ensure
	that fairly good prints from poor negatives will be the
	rule instead of the exception.</p>

	<p>In the first place we have often read that a strong
	light overcomes contrasts, while a weak light increases
	them. Yet how many of us realize when
	we come to make prints by any process exactly
	what this means; in other words, how many of us apply
	the rule in everyday practice? It is very easy to see
	what is meant by the rule if we will take an ordinary
	negative, such as a landscape with clear sky, and hold
	it first six inches from a gas-flame and then six feet.
	It will be found in the first case that the sky portion is
	translucent while the clear glass will, of course, be clear;
	in the second the sky will be opaque and the clear glass
	still clear. The contrasts have been rendered greater
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"></a>by removing the negative further from the light-source.
	As this is true in the extreme case given, so it
	is true in a smaller degree where the distances are only
	slightly varied, as well as where we deal with the
	graded portions of the negative instead of with only
	clear glass and the densest portions. It is this fact
	that we utilize in bromide printing; and it is because
	we have such unlimited control over the strength of
	our light that it is possible with it to get equally good
	prints from a wide range of negatives. It is very much
	simpler and more practicable to regulate the strength
	of the light by increasing or diminishing its distance
	than by interposing sheets of paper, ground glass, or
	opal, as is occasionally done with other processes.</p>

	<p>The necessity, however, for occasionally changing
	the strength of our light in this manner may seem to
	introduce an element of uncertainty into the problem
	of exposure; but there is another rule which brings it
	back again to simplicity itself, and enables us to
	quickly calculate equivalent exposures at varying distances
	from the light-source. This rule is: “The intensity
	of illumination varies inversely as the square
	of the distance from the source of light.” For instance
	if a given negative requires five seconds exposure at
	one foot from the light, it will have an equivalent exposure
	if exposed for twenty seconds at two feet, the
	square of one being one, and of two being four.</p>

	<p>It remains then only to apply these two rules to
	our actual work with bromide paper. The shadows
	in a certain negative will receive full exposure, say,
	in eight seconds at one foot from the light; but the
	high lights of the negative are so dense that no light
	<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"></a>will penetrate them at that distance from the light in
	that length of time. Hence a stronger light must be
	used, or the action of the same light continued for a
	longer time; but the latter will not do since the effect
	would be to over-expose the shadows. Hence, knowing
	that a strong light overcomes contrasts, we move the
	negative to the distance of six inches, where the rule
	tells us the equivalent exposure will be one-fourth
	that at twelve inches, in this case two seconds. Here
	the shadows get no more light, but it is possible that
	the high lights of the negative will be penetrated by
	reason of the additional force of the light.</p>

	<p>On the other hand we have a thin, flat negative requiring
	for the shadows two seconds exposure at one
	foot from the light. Knowing that a weak light increases
	contrasts we move the negative three feet
	from the light, and instead of two, give eighteen seconds
	exposure, the rule telling us that this is equivalent.
	Thus we are enabled to regulate the strength of our
	light to suit the character of our negative. But a
	standard distance of one foot will not suit with all kinds
	of lights or with all sizes of negatives. If, for instance,
	our light is a Welsbach burner, giving an intense and
	comparatively white light, we will find that a normal
	negative will print too flat if exposed at one foot. In
	such a case two or even three feet would be a better
	standard. Experience with our light will, however,
	furnish the best standard, always taking a standard
	negative for the tests.</p>

	<p>The size of the negative also has its influence on the
	unit of exposure. For instance, we may have a half-inch
	oil-burner, in which case we would probably
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"></a>have to expose a standard negative at four inches in
	order to get the proper contrasts. But this is out of
	the question with a negative of <span class="keep_together">5 × 7</span> or over, as a reference
	to the diagram, Fig. 1, will clearly show. <img class="image_right" src="images/fig1.png" width="324" height="326" title="Figure 1" alt="Diagram showing the spread of the light of a flame." />Here
	we find that while
	the centre of a negative
	is four inches
	from the light the
	extreme edges will
	be over five inches
	from it, the rule as
	to intensities telling
	us that the light at
	the edges will be
	only ¹⁶∕₂₅ of that at
	the centre. This
	would result in a
	marked falling off
	of light at the corners, and would necessitate a constant
	motion of the printing frame throughout exposure,
	which is not wholly satisfactory. The remedy would
	be to use a stronger light at a greater distance. But
	another reference to Fig. 1 will show that if a <span class="keep_together">5 × 7</span>
	negative be held at seven inches from the light the
	difference will be only as 49 is to 56, which can in
	practice be disregarded, though it would be better to
	have it even less. Hence we see that it is never safe
	to have our unit less than the base-line of our plate, and
	it is better to have it even greater, as we will frequently
	be obliged to halve the distance to overcome contrasts.
	It follows from this that the larger our negatives the
	stronger must be our light.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"></a>Now all of these considerations may make very dry
	reading, but the reader who has followed them closely
	will see how vital they are to successful work. It
	should not be thought, however, that every exposure
	on bromide paper must involve an arithmetical calculation.
	On the contrary, once the proper distance
	from the light for the normal negative has been ascertained,
	it will be found that nine negatives out of ten
	will require no change in the distance from the source
	of light. This, of course, presuming that we classify
	our negatives and enlarge from those of the same
	quality at the same time.</p>

	<p>One great objection to the use of bromide paper is
	that it must be handled in a dark-room. But this
	objection is not as serious as it may seem. An ordinary
	living room at night furnishes a delightful place in
	which to make prints, if we handle our solutions with
	reasonable care. The ruby glass can be removed from
	the dark-room lamp, and the orange glass used alone.
	But in this case, as indeed with the ruby light, care must
	be taken to guard against too much light. Development
	should be conducted at a distance of several feet
	from the light, and when almost completed, the tray
	can be brought close under the light to enable the worker
	to stop it at exactly the right moment. Ordinary
	bromide paper is about as sensitive as the process
	or slow dry plate or the average lantern-slide plate,
	and requires as much care as either, but not nearly so
	much as the most rapid dry plates. If fogging is
	noticed, of course additional precautions should be
	taken at once.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="keep_together">Nothing</span> more than will be found in an ordinary
	dark-room will be found necessary in
	bromide printing by contact, unless it be some
	arrangement for determining readily the distance of
	the negative from the source of light. For this purpose
	and with an oil-lamp, use a board a foot wide and about
	three feet long placed on the developing bench against
	the base of the dark-room lamp. It should be marked
	with black lines six inches apart. See Fig. 2.</p>

	<p><img class="image_right" src="images/fig2.png" width="300" height="121" title="Figure 2" alt="A circle next to a strip that has markings 1, 2, 3" />Greater uniformity
	in lighting will be
	gained if a piece of
	white cardboard be
	placed immediately
	behind the flame.
	Some lamps have reflectors, in which case the card
	is unnecessary, provided that they reflect the light
	uniformly; otherwise such reflectors are worse than
	useless.</p>

	<p>Having arranged the needful apparatus to our
	satisfaction, the last preparatory step before manipulation
	is the making up of a developer. Almost any of
	the modern developers (pyro excepted) will give good
	<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"></a>results with bromide paper. In every package of
	paper will be found the developers advised by the
	manufacturer of the paper used. Invariably there is
	among these a formula for ferrous oxalate developer.
	This is probably the best of all developers for pure
	black tones, but I cannot advise the novice to take
	it up in the early stages of his work with bromide
	paper.</p>

	<p>When this developer is used an acid clearing bath is
	necessary, and this invites complications which may be
	disastrous to the prints. When experience has been
	gained, and a large number of prints are to be made
	at one time, it will be found advantageous as working
	longer with greater efficiency and more uniformity
	than some of the other developers. It is troublesome
	to prepare and does not keep well, apart from which
	there is the disadvantage that it does not permit of
	control in development in as large a measure as other
	developers.</p>

	<p>A reliable metol and hydroquinone formula is as
	follows: Thoroughly dissolve metol, ¼ ounce; hydroquinone,
	¼ ounce; in water, 80 ounces; add sulphite
	of soda (cryst.), 4 ounces; and carbonate of soda (cryst.),
	2½ ounces. Bottled in 4-ounce vials and well corked,
	this developer retains its working power indefinitely.
	For normal exposures I take 2 ounces of the above and
	add to it 2 ounces of water. This will suffice for the
	development of three <span class="keep_together">8 × 10</span> sheets of paper, or their
	equivalent in smaller sheets. It is not wise to attempt
	to make it do more, as greenish tones will result. For
	the same reason, contrary to common opinion, I do not
	advise the addition of potassium bromide to the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"></a>developer. It does not improve the developer, and may
	do harm.</p>

	<p>An excellent developer which must be used freshly
	mixed, and may be made up in a moment, is as follows:
	Take 1½ ounces of a 25 per cent solution of sodium
	sulphite; dry amidol, 30 grains; 5 to 10 drops of a 10
	per cent solution of potassium bromide, and dilute with
	4½ ounces of water. A supply of new developer
	should be added as this is seen to become exhausted.</p>

	<p>Other developing formulae could be given, but these
	two will be found to fill all requirements if properly
	compounded and intelligently used.</p>

	<p>The greatest difficulty in developing bromide paper is
	to get rich black tones when desired, but this can be
	completely overcome by using entirely fresh developer
	from time to time, and never over-working the developer,
	whatever it may be. As compared with the
	paper, developer is cheap, and it is poor economy to
	save on the latter.</p>

	<p>Except in rare instances the developer is better
	without any modifications whatever. In case of over-exposure,
	either general or partial, the developer after
	having been diluted as stated should be again diluted
	with its bulk of water. This gives blacker tones and
	more depth and life to the shadows. When through
	inadvertence we under-expose a print it may frequently
	be saved after partial development in the weak solution
	by flooding with a strong undiluted developer.</p>

	<p>The temperature of the developer is of the greatest
	importance. In summer the aim should be to keep it
	approximately at 65 degrees Fahr., in winter, 70 degrees,
	but it should never be allowed to go over the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"></a>latter. This can readily be accomplished by placing
	the graduate in a receptacle containing ice-water in
	summer or hot water in winter.</p>

	<p>The paper is first opened at a safe distance from the
	dark-room light, and it is well at first to cut up one
	sheet into several slips to use as test-strips. If any
	difficulty is found in determining which is the sensitive
	side, it will be well to throw a piece of the paper on
	a plane surface when it will be seen that it has a slight
	tendency to curl. The concave is the sensitive side.
	Taking a standard negative we first take one of the
	test-slips and place it upon the negative so that it
	covers a portion containing both high lights and shadows.
	With an oil-lamp having a 1-inch burner, expose
	the test-strip behind the negative in the printing
	frame at one foot for ten seconds. Close the lamp and
	flood the exposed strip with the developer. The
	image should appear in a few seconds, and if properly
	exposed development will be completed in from one
	to two minutes, usually one. Rinse for a moment,
	and place the strip in a fixing bath made up by dissolving
	3 ounces of hypo in 16 ounces of water. After
	a few moments examine the strip in full light, and see
	whether the contrasts are right. If so, expose a full
	sheet of paper, this time rinsing the exposed sheet before
	development to avoid the formation of air-bubbles.
	If the contrasts are too great try a strip at six inches
	from the light and two and a half seconds exposure.
	If still too great, use a stronger light or try a longer
	exposure and use a very dilute developer. If still too
	great the negative is hopeless and should be reduced
	unless dodging will help it, as set out further on.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"></a>It will be noticed that this method calls for a one-minute
	development. This is desirable for several
	reasons: first, because it gives a unit and assists us in
	determining the correct exposure of other negatives,
	and second, because it is a comparatively short development,
	and yet gives sufficient time after the image
	has acquired the proper depth to pour off the developer
	and flush with water, thus stopping development. It
	also leaves sufficient margin in the event of over- or
	under-exposure. With one minute as the unit, over-exposure
	will result in a fully developed image in, say,
	thirty seconds. This print we could save; but if our
	unit were thirty seconds it would be extremely difficult
	to save a print which had completed development in
	fifteen seconds. The chances are that the development
	would go on to a ruinous extent before we could pour
	off the developer and flood the print, or that it would go
	on even after the water was poured on it. Moreover,
	in case of under-exposure, two minutes would not be
	so very tiresome, but four minutes would, besides
	which we would risk straining the print by such prolonged
	development. While I am not prepared to
	assert it as a rule, yet it has been my experience that
	the time of development varies almost inversely with
	the length of exposure; so that if the test-strip concludes
	development in half a minute with ten seconds
	exposure, I give the next five seconds exposure in the
	expectation that it will take a minute to develop.
	This assists greatly in lessening the number of test-strips
	required to ascertain the correct exposure of a
	given negative.</p>

	<p>Should we wish to see a proof before the negative
	<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"></a>is dry, it is taken from the fixing bath and well rinsed,
	though not necessarily thoroughly washed. It is then
	placed face up in a tray of water, on which we place
	face down a sheet of bromide paper. The two are
	removed together and squeezed lightly into contact to
	remove air bubbles. The back of the negative is then
	wiped to remove superfluous water, and an exposure of
	several times the normal given, preferably the normal
	exposure at half the standard distance from the light.
	The paper is then removed and developed as usual.
	In this way it is possible to show a print in fifteen or
	twenty minutes after the exposure of the plate was
	made.</p>

	<p>The purpose of the rinsing before development is
	to avoid the possibility of air-bells. The paper should
	be rinsed in cold water, as warmish water will cause
	air-bells instead of preventing them. This rinsing
	can be dispensed with if thought desirable. The
	rinsing after development is for the purpose of stopping
	development immediately, and also in order that the
	prints may not go into the fixing bath full of developer,
	as staining would be likely to result in such case.
	With the iron oxalate developer an acid rinsing bath
	is necessary, but it is not necessary with any of the
	other developers.</p>

	<p>The fixing is important, as upon this depends in a
	large measure the permanence of the prints. The
	bath should be freshly made up, 3 ounces of hyposulphite
	of soda to 16 ounces of water. Prints are placed
	in this bath face down, and one under, instead of on
	top of another. The tray should be occasionally rocked.
	With a fresh bath prints will fix in ten minutes, but
	<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"></a>where many prints are made at one time it will be well
	to use a second fixing bath. The emulsion of an unfixed
	print will appear a yellowish tinge in the unfixed
	portions when examined by transmitted light; but
	this is not an easy or certain test. It is better to
	make absolutely certain of thorough fixing by continued
	immersion, occasional rocking and, where
	many prints are made, a second bath. The fixing
	bath should not be allowed to get too warm in hot
	weather. Blistering, staining and frilling will result
	in such a case, and I have known a print which was
	left in a warm fixing bath for an hour or more to be
	reduced beyond redemption. With freshly made
	hypo baths at a suitable temperature there is absolutely
	no danger of the paper frilling or blistering.</p>

	<p>The final washing must be thorough, as the hypo is
	difficult to eliminate from both the emulsion and the
	paper. Care must be taken to see that the prints are
	well separated while washing. This ensures uniform
	washing.</p>

	<p>It frequently happens that a negative may require
	more or less dodging in printing. With bromide paper
	this is particularly easy. We will take the simple case
	of a negative with dense sky which will not print out
	in the ordinary way. All that we need in this case
	is a piece of paper cut roughly to the sky line and kept
	moving during part of the exposure over the part
	which is to be held back. If necessary, cut down the
	light in order to prolong the exposure, or expose at a
	greater distance from the light. One or more test-strips
	will be required for this purpose in order to
	ascertain the relative times of exposure. A modification
	<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"></a>of this method is when a small portion of the
	negative only needs extra printing—a face or hand for
	instance. Here we take a piece of paper a little larger
	than the negative and cut a small hole in it, moving it
	in front of the light so as to throw the latter only upon
	the portions needing the extra printing. Still another
	modification is where a portion only needs holding
	back. Here we use a small piece of paper or cardboard
	stuck on a knitting needle, moving the latter
	so that it will not intercept the light too long at one
	place.</p>

	<p>In all these and similar instances which will occur to
	the reader, the dodging should be done during the first
	part of the exposure. The subsequent exposure seems
	to obliterate traces of such dodging better than when
	it is done at the end of the exposure, just as in cloud-printing
	better results are achieved by printing the
	sky first and the foreground afterward.</p>

	<p>It is quite possible to make bromide negatives in the
	camera. They have their advantages in classes of
	work not requiring the finest definition, are much
	lighter, cheaper, more easily stored and less liable to
	breakage or other mishaps. They are best made on
	a thin, smooth paper, a <em>soft</em> paper being better than the
	<em>hard</em>. They are placed in the plate-holder by means
	of the ordinary cut film holder. The exposure required
	is ascertained by a trial or two, but roughly
	speaking is about one-twentieth that of a rapid plate.
	After development in the usual way—it being carried
	only a little further than usual—and after fixing, washing
	and drying, the paper negative can be spotted or
	retouched, after which it is waxed.</p>

		ENLARGING—DAYLIGHT METHODS</h2>

	<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">In</span> taking up enlarging a full knowledge of what has
	been said as to the manipulation of bromide paper
	will be necessary, as the principles governing
	exposure apply here as in contact printing, errors
	being even more serious, owing to the greater waste
	of material.</p>

	<p>For the illuminant used in enlarging, we may employ
	either daylight or artificial light. The former is
	cheap, but variable; the first cost of the latter is quite a
	little sum, but the light is uniform. A daylight enlarging
	apparatus can be made for a dollar or two, and
	hence is within the reach of all; and if the process be
	given up, the loss is not serious.</p>

	<p>If the cost is of little or no moment, very serviceable
	enlarging cameras can be bought for about twenty-five
	dollars. Such a camera is adapted for reducing as
	well as enlarging, and so will be found useful for lantern
	slide making, copying, etc. As a matter of fact,
	few things are as useful to the amateur as a good
	enlarging outfit.</p>

	<p>We will first consider enlarging by daylight with
	home-made apparatus. For this purpose a room with
	at least one window will be needed. It should preferably
	be convenient to the dark-room. If the window
	<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"></a>of this room commands a view unobstructed by
	buildings, trees or the like, so much the better. I personally
	prefer a south light. With this one can get
	soft enlargements from the most contrasty negatives,
	while by shielding the negatives from the direct rays
	of the sun we can work from negatives which are quite
	flat and lacking in
	contrasts.</p>

	<p><img class="image_left" src="images/fig3.png" width="336" height="438" title="Figure 3" alt="A template for making the box described below." />But whatever the
	room chosen, all
	windows but the
	one at which we
	are to work must
	be blocked up.
	This can be done
	by heavy dark curtains,
	or by specially
	constructed
	frames covered
	with light-tight material
	and made to
	fit closely in the
	windows. If there
	are any transoms
	these should likewise be covered. White light entering
	under the doors can be shut out by placing a rug along
	the bottom of the door. Care must be taken that the
	window-frames fit closely, as the light from openings
	at the windows would soon fog a sheet of bromide
	paper if it fell upon it even for a few moments.</p>

	<p>Assuming that the room chosen can be made practically
	light-tight, we will need some arrangement to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"></a>hold the negative. The details of a box for this
	purpose can best be shown by a diagram (Fig. 3).
	ABCD is a strong and neatly made box open at both
	ends, and about two inches larger each way than the
	largest negative from which enlargements are to be
	made. E represents a section of a
	board which forms part of a window
	frame, a general view of
	which is given in Fig. 4. <img class="image_right" src="images/fig4.png" width="168" height="241" title="Figure 4" alt="A detail of the box." />Reverting
	to Fig. 3, F is an opening cut
	in the side of the negative box two
	inches or a little less from the back
	of the box, AD, and wide enough to
	admit the free passage of a negative
	in a kit or other holder. On
	the inside of the box are tacked
	strips, GGGG, to serve as a guide to the kit when
	placing it in the box. An opening similar to F should
	be made in the other side of the box to permit lateral
	adjustments when we come to use the apparatus,
	besides enabling us
	to put the negative
	in or withdraw it
	from either side. A
	convenient modification
	of the strips,
	G, is found by placing
	the front ones a short distance further forward, to
	wit, toward BC, as they are shown in the cut (Fig. 3),
	and tacking to them a piece of watch spring, H, this
	then serving both as a guide and as a means of pressing
	the kit or negative holder against the other strips,
	GG (Fig. 5).<img class="image_left" src="images/fig5.png" width="321" height="153" title="Figure 5" alt="A side view of the box." /></p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"></a>J is a sheet of ground-glass, which is tacked over the
	opening when the box is firmly set in the board, E. It
	is well to have this ground-glass fixed in place so that
	it can be readily removed if desired.</p>

	<p>The necessity for having the box at least two inches
	larger each way than the largest negative from which
	enlargements are to be made is shown in Fig. 6. <img class="image_left" src="images/fig6.png" width="142" height="234" title="Figure 6" alt="A side view of the negative in the box." />Here
	AB represents the negative in place,
	CA, DB and EG represent rays of
	light entering the box. It will be seen
	that the rays CA and DB strike the
	ground-glass at an angle, but nevertheless
	at an angle which results in
	their passing through it in a considerable
	degree. They strike the negative
	AB, but if the negative were the
	full size of the box, to wit FG, it will be
	seen that while the section AB would be fully lighted,
	the sections AF and BG would receive no oblique rays
	at all, and hence the negative would not be even approximately
	uniformly lighted. This point is too often
	overlooked in the construction of apparatus of this
	character, but is necessary in all cases of daylight
	enlarging and especially when direct sunlight is used.
	Now with the negative box in place, some arrangement
	must be made for holding the lens, which can be
	the lens used for making the negative. This for enlargements
	of a fixed size from negatives of a given
	size can be accomplished by simply extending the
	section BGGC Fig. 3, to a proper distance and placing
	the lens in the end of it; but this permits too little
	opportunity for adjustments and is not advisable.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"></a>A double box, one sliding within the other, would be
	better, but still not quite satisfactory. It is far better
	to adapt one’s camera to the apparatus, and this
	can always be done; it being very simple with a reversible
	back camera, which can be backed right up to
	the opening, and more difficult but always possible
	with others. Fig. 7 shows the entire apparatus in
	place, and the manner in which it is used. AB is the
	window board, C is the negative box, D is the camera
	adjusted to the latter, E is the enlarging screen on an
	easel to hold the bromide paper, and F is the reflector.
	The screen on the easel can be made either to rest on
	the floor or on a table. It can be made to run on a
	track or otherwise, and it can also be made so as to admit
	of either vertical or lateral adjustment or both,
	or it can be nothing more than an ordinary box set
	on a table. But however constructed it must be considerably
	larger than the largest sheet of bromide paper
	which is to be used, thus allowing for nearly all necessary
	adjustments of the paper. It is preferably covered
	with white paper or fine blotter to aid in focusing.
	The reflector F is considerably larger than the negative-box,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"></a>and adjusted at an angle which will reflect the
	light from the sky or sun evenly upon the ground
	glass. It is best covered with good white blotting
	paper. G is a hood which I have found useful in sunlight
	enlarging, especially in summer when the sun
	is almost overhead. It is placed on the outside of
	the window-frame, some distance above the ground-glass,
	and shields the latter from the direct rays of the
	sun, which would otherwise cause uneven illumination
	owing to their too great obliquity. The direct
	sun on the white reflector will give a light of high
	intensity. In winter, however, when the sun is low,
	it will fall directly on the ground-glass, and this, if
	the negative box be constructed as advised, is not
	objectionable, but on the contrary an advantage.
	In Fig. 4 the opening, FGHI, represents a sheet of
	ruby glass, and can be screened while focusing if found
	to interfere with the worker’s convenience in that
	operation.</p>

	<div class="image_center">
		<img src="images/fig7.png" width="498" height="241" title="Figure 7" alt="A sketch showing the apparatus described above." />
	</div>

	<p>The apparatus as sketched will suffice for all ordinary
	work. Modifications of it will depend upon the ingenuity
	of the man who attempts to design or construct
	one. It should be noted that the distance of the
	ground-glass from the negative has its influence in the
	strength of the light, and it is better to have this distance
	not over two inches. If less than one inch, however,
	the diffusion of light is not so good. When the
	light is weak the ground-glass can be removed entirely;
	the negative will thus be viewed directly against the
	white reflector. Very strong negatives giving undue
	contrasts may also be dealt with in this way. Or, if
	the light is too strong for flat negatives, the reflector
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"></a>can be removed entirely, or to the same end a sheet
	of yellow glass can be substituted for the ground-glass,
	thus increasing contrasts. In fact, a very useful and
	easily arranged modification of the negative-box consists
	of an opening in the top of the box inside the room
	through which can be dropped an extra sheet of ground-glass
	or opal to cut down the light, or of yellow glass
	to increase contrast. This opening should be at the
	point K, Fig. 3.</p>

	<p>I have referred to a kit as being the proper arrangement
	for holding the negative. This, after much
	tribulation in working with home-made contrivances,
	I have found to be the best arrangement. They
	come a size or two larger than the negative with which
	they are to be used, and can easily be cut down to the
	proper dimensions. With it, also, other kits to hold
	smaller negatives can readily be used. It is also simple
	with them to fasten the negatives in place. If they
	extend beyond the box on either side so much the better;
	greater lateral adjustment can then be made. The
	negative box, Fig. 3, is best painted dead black inside
	in the section GBCG, and white in the section AGGD.
	The reasons for this will be obvious at a glance.</p>

	<p>In enlarging from films it is well to place them between
	two sheets of glass of proper size, and fasten
	the whole in the kit or negative-holder. For this purpose
	use thin glass without flaws or scratches. If
	the films are smaller than the opening in the kit, it
	is well to paste a black mat on one of the glasses,
	when, after proper adjustment, the film will remain in
	place between the two glasses with very little pressure.</p>

	<p>Enlarged negatives are very easily made with the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"></a>apparatus described. A contact positive can be made,
	preferably on carbon transparency tissue, and from
	this the enlargement made, or an enlarged positive
	made first, and from this a contact negative. The latter
	plan is preferable, since it admits of retouching on both
	positive and negative. Slow plates should be used
	throughout. For those who do not care to go to the
	expense of experimenting with large plates, I would
	suggest that good contact positives be first made and
	from these negatives on bromide paper, <em>Standard A</em>,
	<em>soft</em>. These negatives are treated as already described.
	The best positive for this purpose is a thin one with
	full gradations of tone from clear high light to deep
	shadow, without veil or fog, but free from any suspicion
	of flatness.</p>

	<p>The form of light-box presupposes the choice of
	illuminant, and in this there is a wide range. Suffice
	it to say that a kerosene lamp with one or more one-and-a-half
	inch burners will be found suitable for very
	small work or weak negatives. For larger work or
	stronger negatives a stronger light will be needed.</p>

	<p>Of these, the first in point of strength is the arc-light,
	which is too strong for ordinary negatives to be
	enlarged not more than fourfold on ordinary bromide
	paper. Used with any of the slower papers it will be
	found very serviceable and satisfactory. Next comes
	the lime-light, which has pretty much the same advantages
	and disadvantages. After these come acetylene,
	a gas giving an intense light of high actinic
	power. This is within the reach of nearly all, as a
	first-class generator costs only about twelve dollars,
	and the uses of the gas are manifold. The same generators
	and burners can be used with a projecting
	<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"></a>lantern and will be found far more satisfactory than
	oil. Acetylene burners can be had in various sizes,
	ranging in power from thirty to several hundred candle-power.
	The carbide from which the gas is generated
	is not expensive and costs only a few cents each time
	the machine is loaded. By an adjustment attached
	to the generator the gas is kept at a constant pressure,
	and hence the light is unusually steady. All in all
	this light has many advantages. After it in strength
	comes the Welsbach burner, suitable for those having
	gas in the house. After this comes the ordinary gas-burner,
	and then oil. The reader, knowing now what
	will be required of his light, can take his choice.</p>

	<p>Perhaps the simplest form of light-box is where the
	light is placed in one room and the enlarging done in
	an adjoining one, the light being admitted through a
	suitable opening. This prevents the possibility of
	stray light reaching the paper and is productive of no
	additional heat in a room presumably already hot
	enough.</p>

	<p>If this is not feasible a light-box must be constructed.
	As these vary so much in material and design, and
	must be altered with different forms of light in use, I
	will merely state the requirements. First of these is
	that it must be light-tight, and second, that it must
	have adequate ventilation and be fire-proof. Following
	these in importance, there should be a simple arrangement
	for looking at the light from time to time
	to see that it is burning properly and some means for
	readily attending to it if it is not.</p>

	<p>Having the light-box, the burners must be placed
	in it properly. Here the shortest way out of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"></a>difficulty is to go to an expert. If electricity is used
	go to an electrical supply house; if gas, go to a gas-fitter.
	As will be seen later the flame itself must be
	placed in a certain relation to other portions of the
	apparatus, and provision must be made accordingly.</p>

	<p>In looking over the magazines and annuals we will
	now and then see some new method given for illuminating
	evenly the back of a negative in enlarging or reduction.
	The most of these the writer has tried, but
	he has never found one of them which could be relied
	upon to give even reasonable satisfaction. If the light
	is apparently evenly diffused it is too weak. If strong
	enough it is not evenly diffused. Hence I will recommend
	nothing short of a pair of condensing lenses,
	as these have been proved by experience to be satisfactory
	in every respect if properly handled and
	cared for. The diameter of these must be slightly
	greater than the diagonal of the largest negative from
	which enlargements are to be made. These can be
	bought in pairs, mounted or unmounted, at about the
	following prices:</p>

	<p>The prices asked for condensers vary considerably in
	different price-lists. They can often be had at second-hand
	at a decided saving of expense.</p>

	<p>If it is desired to save the additional cost of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"></a>mounted condensing lenses, they can be comparatively
	easily mounted by anyone at all familiar with tools
	in the following manner:</p>

	<p><img class="image_left" src="images/fig8.png" width="171" height="342" title="Figure 8" alt="Side view of two lenses in a box. Their convex sides are facing each other." />A piece of quarter-inch pine or poplar is cut to a
	square about an inch larger than the diameter of the
	lenses. In the center of this is sawed out a circular
	opening the exact size of the lens. In another board
	of the same dimensions is cut a circle a quarter of
	an inch less in diameter. These
	boards are placed together with
	the grain running in opposite directions,
	to prevent warping, and
	the lens kept in place by a wire
	bent in a circle and clamped in
	place so as to hold the lens, or
	other similar arrangement. See
	Fig. 8. The other lens is mounted
	in the same way. The two are
	mounted with their convex sides
	facing each other and a slight distance
	apart. It is better to place
	between them a thin sheet of finely
	ground glass, as this overcomes the
	bad effects of slight flaws in the lenses, which are not
	uncommon. The combination is then boxed up.</p>

	<p>Having now our light-box, condensers, negative
	box, camera and screen, they are next arranged in
	the order shown by Fig. 9. A long table especially
	constructed for the purpose makes the best base for
	this purpose.</p>

	<p>In putting the apparatus together there are several
	points to be noticed. First, the planes of the lenses,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"></a>negative, projecting lenses and screen must all be
	parallel; second, the centers of all these should be in a
	single straight line, and third, either the light or the
	condensers should be so mounted as to easily slide
	backward or forward, since every time the projecting
	lens is racked backward or forward it necessitates a
	corresponding motion of the condensers to or from the
	light.</p>

	<div class="image_center">
		<img src="images/fig9.png" width="442" height="180" title="Figure 9" alt="A box holds (from left to right) a lamp, the two condensing lenses, the negative, a bellows and a projecting lens. The projecting lens is aimed at a screen." />
	</div>

	<p>In constructing the apparatus, for use with condensers
	and artificial light, the same provision should be
	made in the negative box for inserting a piece of colored
	or ground glass as was made in the daylight apparatus.
	When the diameter of the condensers is but little
	greater than the diagonal of the negative it will be
	necessary to have the latter quite close to the former,
	as the cone of light from the condensers has its apex at
	the lens, and hence if the negative in such a case is
	at a distance from the condensers the corners will receive
	no light. Reference to Fig. 9 will show this
	plainly. For this and other reasons it is always best
	to have the condensers of ample size for a given negative.
	In fact, before beginning to make enlargements
	the worker should work with one good negative until
	he finds out exactly what light-intensity is best suited
	<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"></a>to it. This will then serve as a standard for all other
	negatives of the same general grade, and variations of
	the light can be made as required for particular negatives,
	or where the extent of enlargement is materially
	changed for various purposes.</p>

	<p>In using the daylight apparatus, which we will now
	consider, the negative is placed in the holder opposite
	the center of the ground-glass, upside down and facing
	into the work room. The room is darkened and lens
	uncapped. An image more or less blurred will appear
	on the screen. If the enlarged picture is to be only
	slightly larger than the negative, the lens must be
	racked out until its distance from the negative is but
	little less than its distance from the screen. To make
	the enlargement greater we simply rack back the lens
	and move the screen further off. There are tables
	which show exactly the distance which the lens must
	be from the negative and screen in order to get an enlargement
	of a given size: The table here inserted
	covers the ordinary requirements and may be of
	service in constructing the apparatus:</p>

		<p class="caption">The object of this table is to enable any manipulator who is
		about to enlarge (or reduce) a copy any given number of times to do
		<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"></a>so without troublesome calculation. It is assumed that the photographer
		knows exactly what the focus of his lens is, and that he is
		able to measure accurately from its optical center. The use of the
		table will be seen from the following illustration: A photographer
		has a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte</em> to enlarge to four times its size, and the lens he intends
		employing is one of 6 inches equivalent focus. He must therefore
		look for 4 on the upper horizontal line and for 6 in the first vertical
		column, and carry his eye to where these two join, which will be
		at 30-7½. The greater of these is the distance the sensitive plate
		must be from the center of the lens; and the lesser, the distance of
		the picture to be copied.</p>


	</div>

	<p>In practice it is convenient, after having once found
	the focus for a given enlargement from a given negative
	with the lens in use, to mark on the base of the apparatus
	the point to which the lens has been extended. Then
	in making future enlargements of the same size, it is
	only necessary to set the lens at that point and move
	the easel backward or forward until an approximate
	focus is obtained, when the image will be of the proper
	size on the screen.</p>

	<p>As an approximate guide it is sufficient to know that
	the nearer the lens is to the negative the greater will
	be the enlargement, as may be seen in Fig. 7. If a
	piece of thin cardboard, or a sheet of paper cut to the
	exact size of the enlargement desired, is placed upon
	the easel-screen, little difficulty will be experienced
	in getting an enlarged image of the proper size and
	correctly focused.</p>

	<p>It is advisable to focus the enlargement with the
	largest aperture of the lens. If the lens, when working
	at its largest aperture, covers the plate from which
	the enlargement is being made, it will give proper
	definition over the enlargement. With a lens of the
	better sort, of course, the definition will be equally
	good whether a large or small aperture is used; but
	<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"></a>with a low-priced lens it is better to stop down to
	No. 8 (<i>f</i>/11.3) or No. 16 (<i>f</i>/16), to avoid spherical
	aberration. Stopping the lens down increases the time
	of exposure, and enables one to have greater control
	over the operation of exposing the paper, permitting
	time to shade or locally increase the exposure at any
	portion of the image. This is sometimes useful, but
	as a general thing stopping the lens down is not advisable,
	as interfering with one’s judgment in calculating
	exposures for various negatives. Having secured
	the image correct in size and focus, place thumb-tacks
	at all four sides of the sheet of paper or card
	used to focus the image. These will serve as a guide
	to the placing of the sensitive paper. Adjust the lens
	stop as desired and cap the lens, leaving the room
	totally dark save for such safe light as we may have
	for working. Place the bromide paper on the screen,
	using the thumb-tacks as a guide to the correct position
	in this.</p>

	<p>In making his first enlargements, the beginner
	should avail himself of the help of test-strips. These
	should be about one inch wide and the length of the
	paper. The exposure depends on a number of factors,
	among which are light, negative, focal length of lens,
	size of enlargement, stops, sensitiveness of paper,
	developer, temperature of developer, and length of
	development. The first experiment had best, therefore,
	be made on a purely arbitrary basis, for which
	we will take ten seconds.</p>

	<p>Pinning a test-strip on the screen, we uncap the lens
	and with a piece of cardboard shade two-thirds of the
	strip during five seconds; move the cardboard, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"></a>give the next section five seconds making ten for the
	first; then remove the cardboard entirely and give five
	seconds more, making fifteen for the first, ten for the
	second, and five for the third. Now develop the strip.
	If the fifteen seconds portion finishes development in
	less than one minute, and the ten takes approximately
	a minute, we will know that our basis was correct. But
	if all three were over-exposed or under-exposed, as
	shown by one minute’s development, we can expose
	the next test-strip accordingly.</p>

	<p>In determining the correct exposure, the method
	already set forth for contact exposures is a reasonably
	good one. If the paper with a given exposure takes
	half the proper time to develop, halve the next exposure;
	if double the time, or more, double it. More could
	be said on the subject of exposure, and possibly to
	advantage; for instance, there are tables showing the
	exact relation of exposure to the number of times of
	enlargement, but complicated calculations in the
	dark-room are troublesome and a test-strip is simpler.
	After a while one gets the ability to determine the
	approximate exposure required by looking at the
	enlarged image on the screen, correcting slight errors
	by length of development, and greater ones by modifying
	the developer by diluting or strengthening.</p>

	<p>It should be remembered, however, that in judging
	exposure by reference to the screen, we must consider
	the high lights, as well as the shadows. It is in the
	high lights that we need the detail if we are to have
	soft pictures. If this detail in the high lights is plentiful
	and clear we may know that our light is strong
	enough for a very short exposure. If it is very faint,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"></a>we will have to give a long exposure and use diluted
	developer to save the over-exposed shadows. On the
	other hand, if the image on the screen is a flat one, we
	may know that our light is too strong for the negative,
	and it must be modified by removing the reflector or
	by interposing ground or yellow glass; and if neither
	of these suffice, we can simply lay the negative aside for
	a dark day when the light will be very much weaker.
	Frequently all necessary contrasts can be obtained by
	the use of the <em>hard</em> paper before referred to. As under-exposure
	tends to increase contrasts, we should also
	give the minimum exposure in the case of flat negatives,
	abandoning for a time our standard one-minute
	development. As will be seen by this time, there
	are many wrinkles about using bromide paper, and it
	will be found that new ones appear at every <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">seance</em> in
	the enlarging room.</p>

	<p>But why is it that so many of our enlargements are
	black in the shadows and chalky in the high lights?
	Why, simply because our light is too weak for our
	negative. We forget that if we cannot modify our
	negative we must modify our light. It is this characteristic
	of the bromide enlargement which has prevented
	the process from enjoying the popularity it deserves.
	And I sometimes wonder whether this chalkiness is
	due to the use of the north light!</p>

		DODGING, VIGNETTING, COMPOSITE
		PRINTING AND THE USE OF
		BOLTING SILK</h2>

	<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Of</span> all printing processes, bromide enlarging
	offers the best opportunities for successful
	dodging and modification. We can cut our
	light down and take all the time we want, or we can
	take as little time as we want. A hand, a finger,
	a slip of paper, or anything within reach, will suffice
	to shade the light just as we want it. In this connection
	it is well to always hold the shade nearer the lens
	than the easel, as greater diffusion results and there is
	less danger of sharp lines. In shading a foreground
	to bring up a dense sky, first make a test-strip or two,
	noting how long the shading is carried on and how long
	the light is allowed to act on the whole. If the sky
	is then over- or under-printed we can modify it in the
	enlargement proper.</p>

	<p>The best arrangement for vignetting in enlarging
	is a piece of cardboard the size of the negative, with
	an opening cut out at the proper place and about the
	size of the portion of the negative to be vignetted.
	This is held near the lens and moved backward and
	forward between the latter and the screen, the opening
	showing larger as we near the lens and smaller as we
	<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"></a>recede from it. Very tasteful vignettes can be made
	in this way. A favorite method of the writer’s is to
	use a sheet of bromide paper, preferably that with
	rough surface, and print on it a small vignette of a
	portion of a negative. These sheets being of a uniform
	size are then bound in book form, and make very
	attractive souvenirs. Variety can be added to the
	collection by printing some of the pictures through a
	mat fastened on the screen over the paper, when, of
	course, they are bounded by straight, sharp lines.</p>

	<p>Double printing in enlarging is not at all difficult.
	Assuming that test-strips have been made determining
	the proper exposure for each negative, I will briefly
	outline the process. Taking a landscape negative
	with clear sky in which we wish to print clouds, we
	first tack on the screen a sheet of paper the size of
	our bromide, and after properly adjusting and focusing
	it, trace with a pencil the outline of the skyline. We
	then remove the foreground negative and, after tracing,
	cut out a mask conforming to the size and shape of the
	foreground, cutting away the sky. We now put in the
	box the sky negative, and readjust our sheet of paper
	until after proper focusing the desired portion of the
	sky occupies the portion reserved for it, leaving the
	thumb-tacks as a guide when we put our bromide on
	the screen. Now using the sheet of paper as a guide,
	place on the edges of the bromide paper two little
	pencil marks to show how far we shall shade the lower
	portion of the paper. Our mask being the size of the
	foreground negative, it is now only necessary to hold
	it at the proper distance from the lens to have its
	edge conform to the sky-line when enlarged. But
	<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"></a>this would leave a sharp line if held exactly at that
	point, so using the pencil marks on the margin as a
	guide, we slowly raise and lower the mask very slightly
	and just sufficient to cause an agreeable blending of
	the sky into nothing. The proper exposure given, we
	cap the lens, remove the paper and insert the foreground
	negative. Now we must again adjust our
	sheet of plain paper until the sky line marked on it
	coincides with the sky-line on the screen, leaving
	thumb-tacks as usual. Registry being thus secured,
	we simply expose the foreground and develop the
	composite print.</p>

	<p>Needless to say, our clouds must be lighted from the
	same general direction as the landscape. But if in the
	negative they are not so lighted it can be reversed
	in the holder and will then print properly. In almost
	all cloud printing the tendency is to give undue prominence
	to the clouds by printing the sky to too deep a
	tone. This, besides making the blending very noticeable
	at the horizon, results in unnatural effects and
	should be avoided.</p>

	<p>If the sky portion of the landscape negative is thin,
	it might print slightly and spoil the effect of the clouds.
	This can be overcome by using a weaker light in enlarging.
	Where this is not desirable, a mask can be
	cut for the sky portion and used slightly while the
	foreground is being printed. By using it a very little
	during the first part of the exposure the tint will be
	overcome, while objects projecting above the horizon
	will be sufficiently printed. It will be found easier,
	no doubt, to print the landscape first and sky afterwards.
	But this does not result in good work. The
	<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"></a>landscape should invariably be printed after the sky
	portion.</p>

	<p>Bolting silk enlargements were for a time very
	popular. Sometimes they were artistic. Then every-one
	began making them, too often from unsuitable
	negatives, and they fell into disrepute. This method
	of enlarging is, in fact, suitable for very few negatives
	and only where broad effects of light and shade are
	desired. To cut up a spotty negative with a succession
	of lines does not necessarily give a broad effect in the
	picture. But for softening down heavy masses of
	shadows, and blending them harmoniously with masses
	of light or half light, the process is without an equal.
	The bolting silk can be bought by the square yard of
	dealers in photographic supplies, and should be stretched
	evenly over a frame made of quarter- and half-inch
	wood, being tacked between the two strips. This
	frame can be easily adjusted to fit over the paper on
	the screen. By using the side, bringing the cloth
	within a quarter of an inch of the paper, the lines are
	more evident, which is not so objectionable for very
	large work. But for the softest effects, reverse the
	frame and use it at half an inch from the paper. In
	this way we get a soft diffusion of the lines and much
	greater general softness. It should never be used nearer
	than a quarter of an inch, as the lines then become
	too evident, and hence fail in the effect desired. The
	bolting silk comes in three grades, fine, medium and
	coarse. The medium is the best for general work.
	It should not, however, be used for sizes under <span class="keep_together">8 × 10</span>.
	The interposition of the cloth requires about one-half
	additional exposure. Focusing, of course, must be
	<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"></a>done without the frame in place. The bolting silk
	should only be used with paper which is to be toned to
	some color other than black, as there is something
	incongruous in its use with black tones.</p>

	<p>Few branches of photographic work, outside of
	negative-making, are as fascinatingly interesting as
	the making of enlarged prints on bromide paper from
	small negatives. Every amateur has negatives worthy
	of enlargement in his collection, and the process is so
	simple as to be within the capacity of the amateur
	who is still in his first year in photography. Its practice
	will stimulate his interest and help him in all his
	other photographic work. Especially will it help him
	in picture-making, the merits and defects of composition
	being a hundred fold more plainly evident in an
	enlargement than in the small print from the hand-camera
	negative. Moreover, in its essentials, bromide
	enlarging calls for no special equipment other than
	the ordinary hand- or view-camera, and a dark-room
	or other convenient work-room from which all “white
	light” can be excluded on occasion.</p>

		THE REDUCTION AND TONING OF
		BROMIDE PRINTS</h2>

	<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> subsequent manipulations with bromide
	paper do not differ materially from those with
	negatives. The support being paper of course
	makes some difference and the fact that while in the
	negative we aim to get printing density and printing
	color only, in the positive we aim to please the eye,
	makes another. But generally speaking, it may be
	said that whatever we can do with the negative we
	can do with bromide paper, that is, in so far as the
	emulsion itself is concerned.</p>

	<p>The first operation to be taken up is the reduction
	of prints which are too dark. This can best be effected
	just after the prints come from the hypo. A few
	grains of red prussiate of potash are dissolved in a suitable
	quantity of water, the latter being barely tinged,
	not of a strong yellow color. If the print is too dense
	throughout, it can be immersed without previous
	washing in this solution. Reduction should take place
	gradually, and this is best accomplished with a weak
	reducer. If the tray be rocked gently the reduction
	will be quite uniform. If, however, only a portion
	of the print needs reduction, this can be effected by
	applying the ferricyanide solution locally with a brush
	<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"></a>or bit of absorbent cotton. Extreme care is needed
	in this operation. In this way unduly deep shadows
	can be softened, veiled high lights brightened, or almost
	any modification obtained which may be deemed
	desirable. When reduction is almost completed quickly
	rinse the print in running water and then wash thoroughly.
	If the print has been dried, it is only necessary
	to soak it for a few moments in a fresh fixing bath,
	when the ferricyanide can be applied as before.</p>

	<p>Latterly the toning of bromide prints has become
	popular. There are many methods and innumerable
	formulae. Here we shall concern ourselves with the
	sulphide method which best fulfills the three chief
	requirements, namely: (1) Certainty of results; (2)
	the use of few baths; (3) the production of permanent
	prints. Processes which, as regards color, vigor, etc.,
	are beyond the control of the worker, are of very little
	practical use. Equally so, if the toning involves a
	whole string of operations, the final outcome of which
	is usually—a spoilt print. And, lastly, a process which—however
	satisfactory it may be in other respects—impairs
	the undoubted permanency of a black-developed
	print is not one worthy of adoption. In one or two
	other respects, processes vary chiefly as regards the
	depth or intensity which the print must have in order
	to produce the most satisfactory result when toned.
	Thus, prints to be toned with uranium require to be
	distinctly on the pale side, whilst those for sulphide
	toning are best a little vigorous. One or two other
	methods, on the other hand, require the use of the
	costly gold or platinum salts. The latter, except
	under exceptional circumstances, are far better employed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"></a>in the legitimate form of platinotype or other
	platinum paper; bromide prints toned with platinum
	will probably cost more, and will never have the absolute
	permanence peculiar to the platinum print.</p>

	<p>Placed in rough order of merit, the processes available
	are: Sulphide toning (hypo-alum toning is a
	cheaper, slower, and not quite so effective form of
	this method, whilst the thio processes represent sulphide
	toning at its best); copper toning; toning by
	re-development. These methods differ, not only in
	the results which they give, but also as regards the
	perfection with which each attains its particular
	effect; on the principle of the lady in the play who
	spoke the “absolute truth under the circumstances,”
	each may claim to be included among the really
	serviceable processes.</p>

	<p>In the sulphide process, the image which, in a black-developed
	print, consists of metallic silver in fine division,
	is converted into silver sulphide, a substance
	which in the ordinary way is also black, but when
	produced in a fine condition on a photographic print
	is brown to sepia color. Silver sulphide is a most
	permanent substance. Therefore a sulphide-toned
	print should be permanent, too, a conclusion which
	is fully borne out in practice. A sulphide-toned print
	is at least as permanent as the bromide from which
	it is made. The image of the latter is susceptible to
	practically only one agent likely to come in contact
	with it, namely, sulphur fumes from burning gas, which
	partially sulphurize it and give rise to iridescent markings
	resembling those due to stale paper. Now, as the
	sulphide-toned print is the result of this sulphurizing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"></a>process carried out with intention to a state of completeness,
	the result should be—and proves to be in
	practice—immune to this one cause of defacement.</p>

	<p>In converting the silver image into one of silver
	sulphide, the method is to first act on (bleach) the
	silver image with some reagent which will change it
	into a compound of silver susceptible to the action of
	sulphide. Iodine has been used for this, giving an
	image of silver iodide. Bromine gives one of silver
	bromide. A mixture of potass bichromate and hydrochloric
	acid gives silver chloride, as does also a solution
	of chlorine, though in the former case the presence
	of the chromium compounds affects the color
	obtained. But the best of the lot is a solution of the
	two substances potassium ferricyanide and potassium
	bromide, which forms an image of silver ferrocyanide
	and silver bromide. Both of these are converted into
	silver sulphide when treated with a solution of sodium
	sulphide. In the case of the hypo-alum process, in
	which the prints are toned direct (without bleaching)
	in a mixture of hypo and alum, the image is also
	changed into silver sulphide, but only to a partial
	extent. Theoretically, the method is not so good as
	sulphide proper; it is much more inconvenient in
	practice except on a commercial scale, while the results
	cannot be said to quite equal those by the sulphide
	process as regards permanency.</p>

	<p>So much by way of theory. We will now give the
	formulae for the two solutions required in the sulphide
	process. The first of these is the “bleach,” or oxidizing
	mixture of bromide and ferricyanide. Within
	reasonable limits, the proportions of these salts and the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"></a>quantity of each in the solution does not matter very
	much. Each chemical can, if desired, be kept in a
	separate solution if care be taken to keep the mixture
	in the dark,—that is, in a cupboard where it will not
	be exposed constantly to daylight. The ferricyanide
	suffers in time by exposure to daylight; but, as both
	it and the bromide are comparatively cheap and serve
	for a large number of prints, there is no need to take excessive
	care. The ferricyanide-bromide mixture, however,
	keeps very much better than a plain solution of
	ferricyanide alone. Formulae which place the salts
	in separate solutions are a mistake.</p>

	<p>As good a formula as any is: Potass ferricyanide,
	300 grains; potass bromide, 100 grains, water 20 ounces;
	Ammonium bromide may be used in place of the
	potassium salt in the above formula; the difference
	is not marked, but the ammonium compound tends
	to give a somewhat warmer brown or sepia. In the case
	of many formulae, it will be noticed that equal quantities
	of bromide and ferricyanide are recommended.
	Although, as just stated, variations in the formula are
	not at all marked in their effects, a proportion of bromide
	over one-quarter of the ferricyanide does tend
	towards the yellowish color of which complaints are
	now and again heard. I want to make it clear that the
	opportunities for going wrong with the bleacher are
	very small indeed. Without encouraging the reader
	to be careless let it be said that “any old formula”
	(of ferricyanide and bromide) for the bleacher will
	prove successful. Not so, however, in the case of the
	sulphide solution, which requires to be very carefully
	made up and used.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"></a>Sulph<em>ide</em>, not sulph<em>ite</em>. The material for the toning
	or darkening of the bleached print is the chemical
	substance, sodium sulphide, of the formula Na<sub>2</sub>S&middot;9H<sub>2</sub>O.
	This is purchased as small crystals which greedily absorb
	water and rapidly become almost liquid if not
	properly corked. Not that this totally unfits the
	sulphide for use. Sulphide which has gone liquid will
	at all times be found to work perfectly, but it is of
	course open to suspicion, and, in any case, it is not
	possible to know what is the strength of a solution made
	up with such a supply. For this reason, it is best to
	make up the sulphide into solution of 20 per cent
	strength, and add this to water to make the toning
	bath. And it is here that a caution must be noted.
	The weak working solution, which is only about 1 to 2
	per cent strength, keeps very badly indeed, and should
	be made up fresh from the stock solution at the time of
	toning each batch of prints. This is one of the most
	necessary items to bear in mind in using the sulphide
	process.</p>

	<p>Sodium sulphide is sold in various degrees of purity,
	and the label on the bottle is not always in exact correspondence
	with the condition of the substance inside,
	but the two forms which must be adhered to for
	sulphide toning are the ordinary “pure” and the “pure
	for analysis.” The former can be obtained from any
	reliable drug store or photographic dealer. It comes in
	small lumps, yellowish to greenish in color; when dissolved
	in water the solution will be yellow, and will
	usually show a deposit which must be filtered off.
	This sulphide will give tones which are sepia brown
	with most papers. In the case of the “pure-for-analysis”
	<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"></a>sulphide, which is the recrystallized variety,
	the salt will be pure white and will form a quite colorless
	and clear solution in water. The tone given by this
	kind of sulphide is usually of a more purplish color.
	The distinct difference between the two commercial
	varieties of sulphide should not be overlooked, as it
	allows the worker to modify the process usefully when
	dealing with papers differing (as all papers do) to a
	slight extent in their adaptability to sulphide toning.
	The purer form has certainly much better keeping
	properties than the other, but either, if made up in 20
	per cent solution, keeps for a month or two at least—which
	is enough for all purposes. The chief difference
	between the two is noticed in the diluted or working
	solutions. That of the purest sulphide <em>may</em> be kept
	and used again, though it is not really good policy to
	do so.</p>

	<p>The supply of sulphide should therefore be dissolved
	as soon as purchased, as follows: <em>Stock sulphide
	solution</em>—20 per cent; sodium sulphite 4 ounces; water
	to make 20 ounces. The actual toning solution is
	made up at the time of treating the prints by mixing
	the above stock with water, as follows: <em>Sulphide
	toning bath.</em>—Stock 20 per cent solution 3 ounces;
	water to make 20 ounces.</p>

	<p>This makes a bath which contains about one per
	cent real sulphide, corresponding with about a 3 per
	cent solution of the sulphide as purchased. If the bath
	is much weaker, the tone obtained is usually not quite
	so good; while, if it is stronger, there is danger of the
	print’s blistering while toning, or afterward in the
	washing water. Indeed, some papers need to be toned
	<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"></a>in a weaker bath, and require also to be fixed in an
	alum-hypo fixing bath (see later), so that the strength
	of the toning bath given above may be taken as the
	maximum, and used at half or one-third strength, as
	circumstances show to be necessary. And, to repeat
	the caution once more, the toning bath is to be thrown
	away as soon as the prints have been passed through
	it. With these points in our mind as to the making up
	of the solution, we can come to the process proper.</p>

	<p>The prints require to be well washed and free from
	hypo before being placed in the bromide-ferricyanide
	bleacher, because any hypo in conjunction with the
	ferricyanide will form the well-known Farmer’s reducer,
	and cause patchiness of the prints. It is immaterial
	whether the prints are taken direct through
	the toning process or dried in the meantime. Some
	workers contend that the toning process is more regular
	if the prints are dried before bleaching. In either case,
	immersion in the bleacher will cause the fully developed
	bromide to disappear, leaving only a faint brown
	image behind. In some cases the image is fainter
	than in others, the difference appearing to depend
	chiefly on the developer employed. Developers with
	a liability to stain will give prints which do not bleach
	out so completely as those made with cleaner working
	developers. But, in all cases, two to three minutes’
	action of the bleaching solution will be ample; if all
	pure black is not gone in this time, it is a sign that the
	bleach is becoming exhausted. The prints should be
	kept constantly on the move whilst in the solution,
	and turned over and over to ensure equal action. They
	are then given quite a brief rinse in running water—half
	<a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56"></a>a minute to a minute—and then transferred to
	the sulphide solution, where they should darken to
	the full brown or sepia tone in a few seconds. It is
	well always to leave them here for twice to three times
	the period required to give the full tone. A wash of
	half an hour will remove the salts left in the film.</p>

	<p>Granted that bleacher and sulphide are in proper
	working order, there is one further factor in the
	making of sepia prints which is of vital importance,
	and that is the proper preparation of the print itself.
	A good sulphide tone presupposes a good black and
	white bromide. Not only that, defects in the bromide
	which may lie latent while the print is untoned come to
	light in the sulphide bath. This applies to uneven
	fixation (due to omission to keep prints moving in the
	hypo bath) and fingering of the surface; while, as regards
	the original development of the print, making
	the best of a wrong exposure will not do when sulphide
	toning is in view. A print that is forced by long development
	will suffer in tone, the result being colder
	and less satisfactory as regards vigor. Full exposure,
	and development which is complete in the normal time
	for a perfect black print, are the conditions for a good
	sepia tone, and, when a batch of prints is being put
	through, it is well to take steps to preserve a uniform
	time of development in order to secure an identical
	tone throughout.</p>

	<p>There are many different formulas for the uranium
	toning of bromide prints, and I suppose that most of
	them have given good results with the workers who
	published their methods. Of those which I have tried,
	however, none has yielded the results which I have
	<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57"></a>been enabled to obtain from my own formula—my
	own in that I arrived at it by patient experimenting.
	It may be that this formula is not wholly original with
	myself. At any rate, I do not claim anything for it
	except that it works, with me, better than others I
	have tried.</p>

	<p>The requirements for toning bromide prints with
	uranium are: 1 ounce of uranium nitrate; 1 ounce of
	potassium ferricyanide (the red crystals); ½ pound
	bottle of acetic acid—c. p. glacial preferred; water;
	a supply of blotting paper, to be kept exclusively for
	this purpose, and a few absolutely and chemically
	clean trays.</p>

	<p>The expense attached to these toning processes is
	slight. Uranium nitrate costs from forty to sixty cents
	per ounce, and an ounce will last a long time. Potassium
	ferricyanide costs about twenty cents per pound,
	and a pound is ample for a lifetime. Glacial acetic
	acid is a little more costly, but a half-pound bottle
	will prove a good investment. It is used also, as the
	reader will recall, in making acid hypo for acid
	fixing.</p>

	<p>To prepare the toning baths, dissolve the ounce of
	uranium nitrate in 10 ounces of water. The water
	should be distilled if this is easily obtainable, and the
	solution should be kept in an orange-glass bottle or an
	ordinary bottle protected from light by a non-actinic
	paper wrapping. Dissolve the ounce of potassium
	ferricyanide in 10 ounces of water. Keep this also in
	an orange-glass bottle, well corked. There are many
	cautions about this particular salt, and it has been
	said that it will not keep in solution. In my practice
	<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58"></a>I find no difficulty whatever in the use of a solution
	six months old, despite the difficulties mentioned in
	the text-books.</p>

	<p>To tone the bromide prints, first note that the prints
	should have been developed and fixed and washed just
	as usual. It is necessary that prints to be toned shall
	contain no trace of hypo. To secure this, the prints
	should be specially prepared for toning by being
	again thoroughly washed, as any hypo remaining in
	the print will cause spots and streakiness. With care
	at this stage the toning will give clean and bright
	prints, which should be as permanent as the original
	bromide print.</p>

	<p>I cannot give the reason why, but, as a general rule,
	bromide prints tone better if the print has been dried
	after washing and rewet just before toning. There
	may be a chemical reason for this, but I am inclined
	to think that it is a physical one, viz., that the emulsion
	is softer after its first washing than after having
	been dried and wet, so that it allows toning solution
	to get into the film more quickly. This naturally
	results in more rapid toning, and quick toning does
	not yield as good prints as a slower and more gradual
	building up of the color image.</p>

	<p>Having the print ready for toning as here outlined,
	take 1 dram of the uranium solution, add ½ dram of
	acetic acid and then 5 ounces of water. In a separate
	graduate put 1 dram of ferricyanide solution and 5
	ounces of water. Just before toning, pour these two
	solutions together into the third graduate and use
	immediately. To proceed, lay the rewetted print
	face up in a clean tray and flow the freshly made toning
	<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59"></a>bath (the two solutions combined) over the print.
	The print and tray must be kept in motion by gentle
	rocking during the toning operation. The toning
	solution tends to throw a red precipitate as it works.
	This precipitate should not be permitted to settle on
	the face of the print. Some workers tone their prints
	face down, but I do not advocate this, as it is important
	to take the print from the toning bath at just the right
	moment, and, as the toning process is short (six or
	seven minutes is usually sufficient even for the deepest
	red) you need to watch the print all the time. In the
	toning operation note that a constant quiet motion
	of the tray, to keep the solution moving over the
	print, is essential to success.</p>

	<p>I have already given, in an earlier paragraph, the
	order in which the colors come. But that order was
	for a normal print. Some prints behave differently,
	and it is in the control of these unavoidable variations
	with different prints that skill and success come.
	A print of a half-tone subject against a jet-black
	background, a portrait, for instance, will hardly follow
	the normal order in the appearance of colors. This
	because the half-tones will be brown and even red-brown
	before the toning solution has changed the dense
	black deposit of the background at all. If the toning
	was stopped at this stage, some very pretty effects in
	double toning might result.</p>

	<p>From this explanation of the toning process, the
	discerning reader will perceive the need for caution
	in selecting the best kind of a print for uranium toning.
	Thus a print which has a bald-headed sky will tone
	only in the body of the print, but if there is any tint
	<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60"></a>at all to the sky, it also will tone, giving an effect not
	much to be desired except for sunset or sunrise pictures.
	If white high-lights are desired in the toned
	print, they must be white originally and not the least
	bit fogged. As double-toned effects in a print are not
	usually desirable, those prints having deep black shadows
	or dark masses will be avoided. The best kind
	of print for this method of toning is one fully exposed
	and slightly under-developed, since, when the uranium
	does take hold of the shadows, it makes for an increase
	of contrast.</p>

	<p>Experience is the best teacher, and I could not
	begin to describe in detail what the reader can himself
	ascertain from a few experiments. Some prints needing
	contrast should be carried far in the toning solution;
	others, not needing contrast, will give better results
	if they are toned only through the browns, and so on.
	The reader who can spend a Saturday afternoon with
	a few bromide prints, varying in character, will learn
	more from his experimenting than I could tell him
	in many pages. For these experiments waste or
	imperfect black prints can be used with practical
	economy, the chief object being to watch the progress
	of toning and chemical changes.</p>

	<p>When the desired tone is reached, remove the
	print from the toning solution and wash quickly and
	well in running water for fifteen minutes. If washed
	too long, the color of the print will fade and a dead
	and lifeless print will result. If not washed long
	enough, the yellow of the ferricyanide will remain in
	the print, robbing its gradations of brightness and
	purity of color and impairing the permanency of the
	print.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61"></a>A big advantage in this method of toning is its
	wonderful adaptability. There is no hard and fast
	rule as to the proportion of the chemicals to the bulk
	of water used. Try two drams of each of the two
	solutions; then three drams of each, but watch that
	the print does not get beyond you in toning. The only
	practical difference in my formula and others that
	I have seen is that I make my stock solution weaker
	than that ordinarily advised and use less of it to a
	certain amount of water, because I prefer slow toning
	and the accompanying ease of control which the flash-in-the-pan
	formula does not admit. Quick toning,
	like quick development, tends to block the shadows
	in the print, and if you once get bronzed shadows the
	print is practically hopeless. Not quite ruined, however,
	as a bath in a 5 per cent solution of sodium
	carbonate will discharge the color and then, if the
	print is faded, it may be redeveloped in an alkaline
	developer such as metol-hydro. But before it is retoned
	the print must be thoroughly washed, as the
	presence of sodium carbonate does not permit the
	toning solution to do its work.</p>

	<p>Finally, I may say that, while a bath of acetic acid
	and water is often advised to stop the toning action
	in this method, I have never found it necessary.</p>

	<p>All the thin varieties of bromide paper curl badly
	in drying. If they are to be kept unmounted it is
	well to immerse them in water to which has been
	added a few drops of glycerine. This will ensure their
	lying flat after drying. A solution of 2 ounces of
	glycerine in 25 ounces of water is advised when it is
	desired to make bromides on heavy rough paper remain
	<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"></a>flat, after drying, for book illustration and similar
	purposes.</p>

	<p>If one is trying to rush through a bromide print, it
	can be trimmed while wet by placing it on a sheet of
	stiff paper and cutting through both.</p>

	<p>The paper will be found to cockle the mounts badly
	in drying. Aside from the glue mountant, formula
	for which accompanies the paper, I know no preventive
	except to mount the prints while dry with the dry
	mounting tissue. As the paper when wet stretches
	one way considerably, as much as a third of an inch on
	a ten- or twelve-inch length, provision must be made in
	trimming, especially if mounts with centers of a given
	size are used.</p>

	<p>The paper being covered with an emulsion which in
	warm weather is very soft while wet, mounting is somewhat
	more difficult than with some of the other papers.
	My method is to mount not more than half a dozen at
	once, placing them face down, one on top of the other,
	on a glass or ferrotype plate, blotting off the surface
	water and spreading the paste over the top one in the
	usual way. I place this on the mount and then stretch
	over it smoothly a damp handkerchief or piece of very
	thin rubber cloth, rubbing the print down with my
	hands, seldom using the squeegee and then very lightly.
	By this method abrasion of the surface seldom results
	and air-bells are unknown. Owing to the strong
	contracting power of the paper in drying, the mounting
	paste must be used freely, especially at the edges
	of the print.</p>

	<p>Apart from the methods of procedure here given,
	there are innumerable modifications covering every
	<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63"></a>detail of contact printing and enlarging on bromide
	paper. Most of these have been given careful trial
	as published, but few have quite fulfilled the expectations
	they created.</p>
